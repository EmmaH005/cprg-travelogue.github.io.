        Muiderslot is located in Muiden, a city in the Netherlands.
        The castle itself holds a lot of fascinating history and artwork. Some of its most unique features include original furnishings, a garden maintained with traditional herbs and plants, and its battle history. For someone who wants to feel as though they've been transported back in time, this castle will provide the desired effect. Some of my most treasured photos originated from Muiderslot.

        Giethoorn is a small canal village in the Netherlands. One of its main attractions is canal and boat tours that navigate Giethoorn and the surrounding body of water. Here, you can sit on waterside patios and enjoy the calm surrounding enviornment. This town boasts lush vegetation and cobble sidewalks, making for an authentic european experience. If you find yourself walking its streets, stop by the various shops, or take a seat on a bench and chat with the many ducks that populate the canals.
